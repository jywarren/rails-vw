A rails RESTful API for NASA's Vision Workbench suite

OK, let's not assume we're storing images. So we don't need attachment_fu or anything. 

Steps:

- client submits request with 2 image URLs and 
- see if we already have an entry for the image based on filename and other tags? can we do much of this without downloading the image?
- temporarily download the images
- find and match interest points
- create Image and InterestPoint objects in db
- return id for process
- upon process completion, delete stored images

- client can ask for process progress. when state = 'complete' it may request the final data
- return Image unique id and list of interest points and coordinates with regard to image top-left

On the other hand, if we offer uploads without a URL for each image (possible need), we need attachment_fu, and might as well always have a local copy of the image. So we might as well store them.
